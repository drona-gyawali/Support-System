Here's a structured roadmap to build your AI-integrated, scalable support system backend with Django/DRF, organized into phases and days:

---

### **Phase 1: Setup & Core Models (Days 1-4)**
**Day 1: Project Setup**  
- Install Django, DRF, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Docker.  
- Initialize the project and apps (e.g., `users`, `departments`, `tickets`).  
- Configure settings for scalability (e.g., connection pooling, async support).  

**Day 2-3: Database Design**  
- Define models:  
  - `User` (with roles: agent, admin).  
  - `Department` (name, max_capacity, current_traffic).  
  - `Ticket` (status, priority, assigned_to, department).  
- Add relationships (e.g., departments have users, tickets belong to departments).  

**Day 4: Authentication & Permissions**  
- Implement JWT authentication.  
- Add role-based permissions (e.g., admins can merge departments).  

---

### **Phase 2: Queue System (Days 5-9)**  
**Day 5-6: Ticket Management Logic**  
- Create APIs for ticket creation, assignment, and status updates.  
- Add a `TicketQueue` model to track pending requests.  

**Day 7-8: Load Distribution**  
- Implement round-robin or least-busy logic to assign tickets to agents.  
- Use signals or async tasks to auto-update `current_traffic` in departments.  

**Day 9: Testing**  
- Simulate ticket flow with dummy data (e.g., 1000 tickets).  
- Optimize database queries (e.g., `select_related`, `prefetch_related`).  

---

### **Phase 3: Merge Functionality (Days 10-14)**  
**Day 10-11: Merge Logic**  
- Add a `merge_threshold` field to `Department` (e.g., merge if traffic > 80%).  
- Write a service to check overloaded departments and find underutilized ones.  

**Day 12-13: Merge API**  
- Create endpoints:  
  - `POST /api/merge/suggest/` (AI suggests merges).  
  - `POST /api/merge/{department_id}/` (manual merge).  
- Update ticket routing to redistribut traffic post-merge.  

**Day 14: Stress Testing**  
- Test merging under high load (e.g., 10k tickets).  
- Use Django Debug Toolbar to identify bottlenecks.  

---

### **Phase 4: AI Integration (Days 15-19)**  
**Day 15-16: Traffic Prediction Model**  
- Train a lightweight model (e.g., scikit-learn time-series forecasting) on historical traffic data.  
- Save the model to a `prediction_service.py` module.  

**Day 17-18: AI Service Endpoints**  
- Create a `Prediction` API:  
  - `POST /api/predict-traffic/` (returns predicted traffic for next hour).  
- Integrate predictions into merge suggestions.  

**Day 19: Auto-Merge (Optional)**  
- Add a Celery task to auto-merge departments if predictions exceed thresholds.  

---

### **Phase 5: Scalability (Days 20-25)**  
**Day 20-21: Caching**  
- Cache department traffic data with Redis.  
- Use `django-redis` for query caching.  

**Day 22-23: Async Tasks**  
- Offload ticket assignment and AI predictions to Celery.  
- Configure RabbitMQ as the message broker.  

**Day 24-25: Database Sharding**  
- Shard the `Ticket` table by department ID for horizontal scaling.  

---

### **Phase 6: Security & Deployment (Days 26-30)**  
**Day 26-27: Security**  
- Add rate limiting (DRF Throttling).  
- Sanitize inputs and enable CORS only for trusted domains.  

**Day 28-29: API Documentation**  
- Document endpoints with Swagger/OpenAPI.  
- Write unit tests (90%+ coverage).  

**Day 30: Deployment**  
- Dockerize the app.  
- Deploy to AWS/GCP with Gunicorn + Nginx.  
- Set up monitoring (Prometheus + Grafana).  

---

### **Key Tools**  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (with pgBouncer for pooling).  
- **Caching**: Redis.  
- **Async**: Celery + RabbitMQ.  
- **AI**: Scikit-learn/TensorFlow Lite (for low latency).  
- **Testing**: Locust (load testing), Pytest.  

### **Example Merge Logic Snippet**  
```python
# services/merge.py
def auto_merge_departments():
    overloaded = Department.objects.filter(current_traffic__gte=F('max_capacity') * 0.8)
    underloaded = Department.objects.filter(current_traffic__lte=F('max_capacity') * 0.2)
    
    for dept in overloaded:
        target = underloaded.first()
        if target:
            target.agents.add(*dept.agents.all())
            dept.is_merged = True
            dept.save()
```

This roadmap balances feature development, scalability, and AI integration. Adjust timelines based on your familiarity with tools, but prioritize database optimization and async tasks early to ensure scalability.
